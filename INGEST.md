# consumer — Course Consumer & Assimilator

A big concept from a course — configured to work for our systems.

> Full docs: [README.md](README.md) — pipeline rationale, pins, design law.

## AGENTS.md-kin instructions for agents working in THIS repo

- The core is stdlib-only. New core deps require a PR that justifies them against the adopt-don't-rebuild law (zero API keys, zero cloud calls).
- `transcribe.py` runs the STT engine in a scrubbed child env: PYTHONPATH/VIRTUAL_ENV/CONDA* are stripped, ffmpeg's dir is placed first on PATH. Do not "simplify" the env scrub — host kernels leak site-packages into subprocesses and break the venv.
- Pinned provenance: `mlx-whisper==0.4.3`, model `mlx-community/whisper-large-v3-turbo` @ revision `a4aaeec0636e6fef84abdcbe3544cb2bf7e9f6fb`. Output-affecting changes (model, revision, options) bump `TRANSCRIPT_PIPELINE_VERSION` in transcribe.py.
- Every stage writes a provenance record: scrape → `acquisition.json` (url, sha256, tool, timestamp); transcribe → `<stem>.sha256`; distill reads transcripts, never mutates them.
- Tests: `python3 tests/test_smoke.py` — fast, offline, no model download. Run before every PR. CI (GitHub Actions) runs the same suite.
- Commit style: imperative subject, body explains *why* (what wall it removes). PRs follow the same law.
- When adding a capability, ask: does this belong in core (works for anyone with a folder of course files) or in an adapter (MediaPlural-specific wiring)? Adapters go to HANDBOOK.md.

## Pipeline map (machine-readable)

```yaml
pipeline:
  acquire:    { tool: scrape.py,     inputs: [url], outputs: [media/page file, acquisition.json] }
  transcribe: { tool: transcribe.py, inputs: [media file], outputs: [transcript.json, txt, srt, sha256] }
  distill:    { tool: distill.py,   inputs: [transcript dir], outputs: [keywords.json, concepts.json, next-best-seeds.json, course-map.md] }
  assimilate: { tool: HANDBOOK.md adapters, inputs: [distilled dir], outputs: [brain page / render script] }
```

## Quick start for agents

```bash
bash install.sh && export CONSUMER_VENV_PYTHON=~/.hermes/venvs/consumer/bin/python
python3 scrape.py "URL" --out-dir ./course/media --audio-only
python3 transcribe.py ./course/media/FILE --out-dir ./course/transcripts
python3 distill.py ./course/transcripts --out-dir ./course/distilled
```

Or the wrapper: `python3 consumer.py "URL-or-dir" --tag my-course`

Or via MCP: run `mcp-server.py` and call tools `transcribe`, `scrape`, `distill`, `status`.
